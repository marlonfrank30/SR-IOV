Enabling SR-IOV for VMware
date_range11-Jun-21

The physical network interfaces support single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) capability and can be connected to the VMs using PCI passthrough. Before you enable SR-IOV for VMware, note the following:

SR-IOV is only supported with Intel and Mellanoxx Network Cards using ixgbe driver with 10G ports and using i40e driver. Any other NIC models are not supported.

Support for ixgbe driver and i40e driver is available from SPK 1.2.3 onwards.

Starting in SPK 1.2.4, in VMware deployments operating in SR-IOV mode with an ESXi Enterprise plus server, support is available for VLAN-tagged traffic for vMX interfaces.

To enable SPK with vSphere for SR-IOV adapters, perform these tasks:

## **Enable Virtualization Technology in the Server BIOS**
in order to enable SR-IOV capabilities, the BIOS need to support Virtualization Technilogy (VTx) feature. Reboot the Server and then press ESC or F10 in your keyboard. look for System Security adn then Virtualization Technology. Set it to enabled. The Screenshot below was taken from an 820 HP Workstation that supports SR-IOV Virtual Function tecnology. 



## **Enable SR-IOV on a Physical Adapter**

Use the following steps to enable SRX-IOV on a physical adapter. The following procedures are applicable for ESXi version 6.5.
To enable SR-IOV on a physical adapter in vSphere client:
![Architecture Diagram](./images/bios-setting.png)
1.Navigate to the host in the left navigation pane and click the Manage tab. Go to Hardware tab. Under PCI Devices option, select the physical adapter and click Configure SR-IOV option. 
![Architecture Diagram](./images/sr-iov-config-1.png)

In the populated window, select Yes to enable SR-IOV. In the virtual functions text box, specify the number of virtual functions to configure for the adapter. 
Click Save.
Restart the host.
Verify the status of SR-IOV post reboot. The status is displayed as Active. 
Add vSwitch and Port Groups 
Use the following steps to enable SRX-IOV on a physical adapter if you are using ESXi version 6.5:
To add vSwitch and Port Groups:

To create vSwitch: Navigate to Networking tab and select Virtual Switches and click Add standard virtual switch. 
To create port groups: Navigate to Networking tab and select Port Groups and click Add port group. 
Assigning the SR-IOV NIC to the VFP VM
Use the following steps to enable SRX-IOV on a physical adapter if you are using ESXi version 6.5:
To assign the SR-IOV to the VFP VM using the vSphere Web Client:

Power-off the VFP when you add SR-IOV to the VFP VM.
Navigate to the VFP VM in the left navigation pane and click the Manage tab.
Select VM Hardware, and click Edit near the top right corner.
In the Edit setting, go to Virtual Hardware tab and click Add network adapter option.
Under New Network Adapter, select the respective port group for mapping. 
Change Adapter Type as SR-IOV passthrough. 
Map Physical function to respective SR-IOV NIC. 
Click Save.
Now, the SR-IOV interface is added to the VFP VM.
Enable VLAN Tagging on SR-IOV Interfaces 
You can configure VLAN tagging on SR-IOV interfaces on vMX instance deployed in VMware ESXi host with the following steps::
We've used the hardware and software combination for the following procedure:

VMware ESXi version 6.5 Update 3
i40en driver version 1.10.6 for Intel 700 Series network adapters
Firmware version 7.20 for Intel 700 Series network adapters
Enter the CLI configuration mode after logging in to the vMX.
Include the vlan-tagging statement to enable VLAN tagging.
content_copy zoom_out_map
[edit interfaces xe-0/0/0]
user@host# set vlan-tagging
Include the vlan-offload statement to offload the VLAN filtering .
content_copy zoom_out_map
[edit interfaces xe-0/0/0]
user@host# set vlan-offload
Example:

content_copy zoom_out_map
user@host> show configuration interfaces xe-0/0/0 
vlan-tagging;
vlan-offload;
encapsulation flexible-ethernet-services;
unit 0 {
    encapsulation vlan-vpls;
    vlan-id 10;
    family vpls;
}
unit 1 {
    vlan-id 30;
    family inet {
        address 30.30.30.1/30;
    }
}
unit 2 {
    encapsulation vlan-bridge;
    vlan-id 40;
}
Log in to the ESXi Web console . Navigate to Networking and select Port groups tab. Edit the settings for the required port.

Enable the VLAN trunking for the vSwitch that includes the SR-IOV interface. You must set the VLAN value to 4095.
Note the following:

The VLAN ID 4095 allows any VLAN traffic.

The VLAN ID 0 does not allow any VLAN traffic.

Ensure that you have configured the VLAN ID matching to the VLAN configuration on the mapped interface. Example: If you have configured a VLAN ID 100 on the associated logical interface, then use VLAN ID 100 for SR-IOV. This setting enables receive and forwarding incoming frames that contain a matching VLAN ID that is VLAN 100.

Click Save to save your settings.
SR-IOV Interface for Layer 2 Services
To use SR-IOV interface for Layer 2 Services such as VPLS, Layer 2 VPN, Layer 2 circuit or bridging on a vMX instance deployed in VMware ESXi host, you must enable the trust mode and disable the spoof check in Intel NIC settings. Use the following steps to enable the trust mode and disable the spoof check:
Install Intel esxcli plug-in. For instructions, see VMware KB article.
Verify the trust mode and the spoof check status on the SR-IOV NIC by entering the following command in ESXi shell mode:
content_copy zoom_out_map
esxcli intnet sriovnic vf get -v <vf number> -n <vmnic name>
Example:

content_copy zoom_out_map

root@host:~] esxcli intnet sriovnic vf get -v 0 -n vmnic12


VF ID           Trusted         Spoof Check
-----           -------         -----------
0               false            true
Enable the trust mode and disable the spoof check on Intel NIC.
content_copy zoom_out_map
esxcli intnet sriovnic vf set -s false -t true -v <vf number> -n <vmnic name>
Example:

content_copy zoom_out_map
[root@host:~] esxcli intnet sriovnic vf set -s false -t true -v 0 -n vmnic12

Trusted mode is set to true and spoof check is set to false
content_copy zoom_out_map
[root@host:~] esxcli intnet sriovnic vf get -v 0 -n vmnic12
VF ID           Trusted         Spoof Check
-----           -------         -----------
0               true            false
Restart the vMX FPC configured with the SR-IOV interface after changing to the trust mode and spoof check values.
content_copy zoom_out_map
user@host> request chassis fpc slot <number> restart
Once the FPC is online, Layer-2 services start working on SR-IOV interface.
